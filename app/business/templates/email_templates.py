RESERVATION_REPLY = r"""Hi **LESSEENAME**, thanks so much for the inquiry.  We would love to have you stay at The Sheppard Hangar while you go through training!  

We will be sending a separate email to you with the rental agreement attached for your review via a DocuSign email.  If you do not receive it please let us know, we have had problems with the email going to spam folders.   As of now we have a room available for you, however we cannot guarantee a room reservation until we receive the rental agreement document back from you, so if you have any questions with the agreement please contact us as soon as possible.

We will do our best to accommodate any specific room requests, however we cannot guarantee that you will be assigned a specific request.  Just know that we will gladly work with you if you are unhappy with your initial room assignment.  We appreciate your understanding and flexibility.  

Help us spread the word! We are offering a $200 referral gift to those who refer a guest that stays for 30 nights or more at The Sheppard Hangar.  It’s never too late to book with us – on base lodging can be canceled at any time!

If you have any questions please feel free to contact us at any time at (954) 471-6872 and if there is anything that we can do to make your stay more enjoyable please let us know!

Thanks again, all the best,

RECEIVED_DOCUSIGN_BACK = """The Sheppard Hangar DocuSign Receipt

Hi **LESSEENAME**, hope all is well.  We received the DocuSign agreement back, thank you very much.  

We've attached the Welcome package to this email, if you have any questions please give us a call at (954) 471-6872 at any time.

We will touch bases with you closer to your check-in date with the room assignment.  We will do our best to accommodate you in a room that has its own bathroom, however we hope that you understand if we cannot do it right away based on other guests that may already be staying in the house.  

You do not need a Non-A slip when staying with us.  We currently charge less than the authorized on-base rate so you are saving your squadron money by staying with us.  Just in case you need this info:  When creating your travel authorization in DTS; once you get to the “Lodging Step 1 of 3: Select Your Lodging” page on DTS, select the “Skip this lodging booking” option located on the top right of the page. Then continue with the remainder of the DTS authorization. Before submitting the authorization, DTS will perform a Pre-Audit. On the Pre-Audit page, “Lodging Not Used” will flag. It will ask for a reason code for not booking lodging through DTS. For the reason code you may select both “L3 - Lower Rate Available” and “L4 Personal Choice/Limited reimbursement”. For your justification for approving official we recommend you state “I found cheaper lodging of my preference off base.”

We are still offering a $200 referral gift to you for anyone that you refer that stays for 30 nights or more at The Sheppard Hangar, so if you know of anyone else that is coming to Sheppard AFB for training anytime in the future please keep us in mind.

If there is anything that we can do to make your stay more enjoyable please let us know.  We appreciate any and all feedback, good or bad!
Thanks again, we look forward to having you stay at The Sheppard Hangar!
